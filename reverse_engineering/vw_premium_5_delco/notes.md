# Notes

## Single Disc CD Player

The in-dash single disc CD player (1J0 035 119 A) will not function with the Premium 5 radio unless the player is grounded separately (the radio will display `NO CHANGER`).  The cable between the radio and the player is not enough. Ground anywhere on the player's chassis to make it work.  There is a 2-pin connector on the back of the player; this is presumably where the player gets its ground from where installed in the car.

Interestingly, the player seems to work fine on the Premium 4 radio without having to ground the chassis.  It's a good idea to ground it anyway.

## CD Pause

The radio doesn't expose a way to pause while playing a CD, but the player is capable of pausing.  If you are playing a CD and switch to another mode like FM, the CD will stop.  If you then switch back to CD, it will pick up where it left off.  Connecting to the radio with KWP-1281 ("DIAG" mode) also pauses the CD and resumes on disconnect.
