Note 1:
  I had the 09370082 ("N60 FLASH") chip decapsulated and the part number
  "D78F0831Y" was marked on the die.  The '831Y is undocumented but there is
  a reference to it in the change history of the '833Y datasheet.  Also, there
  are '831Y device definition files for RA78K0 assembler package and the PG-FP3
  flash programmer.  The PG-FP3 identifies it as D78F0831Y and can reprogram it.

Note 2:
  I had the 16246476 chip decapsulated but there was no part number marked on
  the die.  Using many Philips datasheets, I suspected it was a TEA6840H after
  comparing the package size along with the power, ground, and crystal pins.
  I then installed a TEA6840H into the radio and it was fully functional.  I
  then had a TEA6840H chip decapsulated.  I compared those die photos to the
  photos of the 16246476 and they were the same.

Note 3:
  In one radio, serial number VWZ4Z7X7040815, I found this chip with the real
  part number on the outside of the package (HEF40160B).  All other radios I
  looked at had the Delco number on this chip.
